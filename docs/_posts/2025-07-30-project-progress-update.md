title: "Project Progress Update: Diving into Playwright + Pytest for Web Automation"
---

Over the past two weeks, I’ve focused on upskilling in modern browser automation and test practices. I’m excited to share that I’ve completed the “Playwright Python and Pytest for Web Automation Testing” course by Packt on Coursera — a solid step forward in strengthening my test automation toolkit. ✅

## 📚 What I’ve Learned:
1. Set up and utilize Playwright for seamless browser automation across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
2. Mastered Pytest for writing modular, data-driven, and scalable test cases.
3. Integrated CI/CD pipelines using Playwright with GitHub Actions for automated test execution.
4. Implemented behavior-driven development (BDD) for comprehensive and readable test coverage.

## 🔄 What’s Next:
I’m now preparing to:
1. Begin development of a Jobscan scraper that leverages everything I’ve learned.
2. Build out core functionality for general-purpose scraping tools — reusable across different websites and use cases.
This will serve both as a practical learning exercise and a foundation for future projects in automation and QA tooling.
