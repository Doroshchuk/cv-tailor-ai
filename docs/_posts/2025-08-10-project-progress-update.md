ðŸš€ Project Progress Update â€” Building on My Playwright Foundations
Since my last update on July 30, Iâ€™ve been putting my Playwright + Pytest skills into practice and strengthening my Python fundamentals.

ðŸ“¦ Project Updates
Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new in the repository:

1. ".gitignore" improvement â€” Added venv to keep the repo clean.

2. JobscanScraper â€” Implemented browser automation with user-agent caching for more realistic scraping behavior.

3. Configuration Refactor â€” Separated Playwright browser settings from Jobscan-specific configuration for better maintainability and reuse.

4. PlaywrightHelper â€” Introduced a utility class for human-like browser automation, including random delays, hover interactions, and mouse movement patterns.

ðŸ“š Skills in Progress
Alongside coding, Iâ€™ve been refreshing my Python knowledge by working through the ProgrammingExpert course (https://www.programmingexpert.io/index) â€” reinforcing core programming concepts to ensure my code is clean, efficient, and scalable.

ðŸ”„ Whatâ€™s Next
1. Continue progressing through the ProgrammingExpert course, aiming to finish the Advanced Programming section and complete the Assessment, then move on to the Software Design part.

2. For the project, automate the process of uploading my CV and scanning it against a particular job position using Jobscan â€” initially with a mocked version before writing the LinkedIn job listing scraper.

3. Get the first working version of the scanning process running and start reviewing the initial results.
