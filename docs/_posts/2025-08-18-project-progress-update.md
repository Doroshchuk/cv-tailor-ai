Since my last update, I’ve made progress both on the learning side and the automation project itself.

📚 Learning Progress
✅ Finished the Advanced Programming section of the ProgrammingExpert course.
⏳ Still need to complete the Assessment before moving on to Software Design.

💻 Project Updates
Committed several improvements to the Jobscan automation workflow:

🔧 Fixes
- Corrected datetime comparison logic for user_agent regeneration.
- Fixed imports in ui_helpers.py and the human_like_mouse_move_and_click() method in PlaywrightHelper.

🗂️ Dashboard Page & Resume Upload
- Added DashboardPage Page Object Model with upload_resume() workflow using PlaywrightHelper.
- Refactored login() into a new run_resume_scan_workflow() with integrated resume upload.
- Implemented automatic resume path resolution and file handling.

📊 Match Report Page & Searchability Metrics
- Added MatchReportPage POM for handling Jobscan match reports.
- Implemented automated improvements for ATS tips and job title matching within the Searchability section.
- Extended JobDetails with a URL field and added a match report URL pattern to settings.
- Added human_like_fill_data() method to PlaywrightHelper for more realistic input handling.
- Integrated match report processing into the resume scanning workflow.

🪲 Automation & Element Handling Improvements
- Fixed Scan button locator and added button state validation.
- Introduced JobscanReportModal POM for popup dialog handling.
- Corrected metric iteration and element state checking logic.
- Fixed job title input mapping and improved input value retrieval.

🔄 What’s Next
1. Complete the ProgrammingExpert Advanced Assessment and start the Software Design section.
2. Extend the MatchReportPage automation with additional metric improvements.
3. Refine the resume scanning workflow to stabilize handling of optional modals and dynamic UI elements.
4. Continue working toward stabilizing the first end-to-end version of the scanning process and begin reviewing the initial results.
