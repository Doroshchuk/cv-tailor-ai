title: "Project Update — AI Tailoring Stabilization & Prompt Enhancements"
---

✅ Learning Progress
1. Completed the ProgrammingExpert course and shared the milestone on LinkedIn alongside the certificate.
2. Started the Data Structures Crash Course on AlgoExpert and began solving LeetCode tasks to reinforce foundational CS concepts.

💻 Project Progress
1. 🔧 AI Tailoring Stabilization & Refactor
- Fixed user agent generation logic to avoid multiple headless browser launches and ensure consistent scraping.
- Refactored TailorAIService to streamline tailor_cv logic and remove unused response_format param.
- Introduced KeywordUtils for consistent keyword JSON conversion throughout the OpenAI integration.

2. 📄 Resume & Match Report Structure
- Refactored JobDetails model to split job descriptions into a structured description_details list.
- Updated MatchReportPage to simplify skill/metric processing and remove unnecessary conditionals.
- Enhanced SkillsAnalyzerComponent to normalize skill matching and remove redundant support checks.
- Introduced MatchReportParserUtils and ResumeParserUtils for easier file-based parsing.

3. 🧠 Prompt Instruction Overhaul
- Expanded prompt_instructions.json to enforce strict handling of keyword integration.
- Added clarity to prevent GPT from assuming/inventing tools or experiences not present in the original resume.
- Renamed "optional_additions" to "adjustment_notes" for semantic precision and better auditability.

4. 📁 File Management & Output
- Implemented write_to_file() in TailoredResumeLite to persist tailored CVs with organized naming.
- Created get_tailored_resume_file_path() utility for saving outputs based on job/company context.
- Updated .gitignore to exclude resume input/output files and maintain a clean repo.

🔄 What’s Next
1. Implement and test CV rescanning — validate tailored resumes using Jobscan to measure match rate improvements.
2. Complete the Data Structures Crash Course on AlgoExpert and solve 5–7 easy LeetCode tasks to reinforce problem-solving fundamentals.
3. Proceed with refactoring existing functionality for improved maintainability and scalability across the tailoring and scraping pipeline.
