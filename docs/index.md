title: CV Tailor AI Blog

Welcome to my blog documenting the development of **CV Tailor AI** â€” a resume tailoring tool built with **Python, Playwright, and AI**.  
This project combines automation, scraping, and AI prompt engineering to streamline the job application process and maximize resumeâ€“job match rates.

Alongside CV Tailor AI, Iâ€™ve been actively upskilling in:
- **Computer Science fundamentals** (AlgoExpert crash courses, algorithm practice)
- **Automation frameworks** (Python + Playwright for UI/API testing)
- **Practical AI integration**

ðŸš€ **Note:** To keep updates clear and focused, all **SDET upskilling progress** (AlgoExpert practice, test framework design, SQL drills) has been moved to a dedicated repo:  
ðŸ‘‰ [SDET Framework Lab](https://github.com/Doroshchuk/sdet-framework-lab)
